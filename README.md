# üöÄ End-to-End DevOps Implementation on an E-Commerce Project  

This project is a **fork of the [OpenTelemetry Demo](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-demo)**, adapted and extended to simulate a real-world **E-Commerce application**.  
It was implemented as part of my **DevOps hands-on learning journey** to gain practical exposure to end-to-end DevOps workflows, resume preparation, and interview readiness.  

The implementation demonstrates a complete DevOps pipeline ‚Äî from **infrastructure provisioning** to **continuous delivery on Kubernetes**, incorporating modern tools and cloud-native practices.

## üìå Project Highlights  

- **Cloud Infrastructure on AWS** using Terraform (VPC, EKS, IAM, Route53).  
- **Containerization** of microservices with Docker and Docker Compose.  
- **Orchestration** using Kubernetes (Deployments, Services, Ingress, PV/PVC, Storage Classes).  
- **GitOps with Argo CD** for continuous delivery.  
- **CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions** integrated with Argo CD for automated deployments.  
- **Custom Domain Setup** with Route53 and Ingress for production-grade accessibility.  
- **End-to-End Monitoring & Observability** via OpenTelemetry (inherited from the demo project).

## üìÇ Project Workflow  

1. **Infrastructure Setup**  
   - AWS configuration, IAM roles, VPC, and EC2 setup.  
   - Terraform backend, remote state management, and state locking with S3 + DynamoDB.  

2. **Containerization & Local Deployment**  
   - Docker installation and Docker Compose setup.  
   - Built and ran microservices locally using Docker Compose.  

3. **Kubernetes Deployment**  
   - Provisioned EKS cluster using Terraform.  
   - Deployed microservices via Kubernetes manifests (Deployments, Services, Ingress).  
   - Configured PV/PVC and storage classes for persistence.  

4. **Custom Domain & Networking**  
   - Configured Route53 hosted zones and integrated with ALB & Ingress.  
   - Exposed services via a custom domain.  

5. **GitOps & CI/CD**  
   - Installed and configured Argo CD.  
   - GitOps pipeline setup for automated deployments.  
   - CI/CD with GitHub Actions integrated with Argo CD for seamless builds and deployments.  

6. **Resume & Interview Prep**  
   - Documented day-to-day tasks from the project.  
   - Prepared interview questions and key takeaways from the real-world workflow.
